# Examples

End-to-end walkthroughs showing Context Teleport in real-world scenarios.

## Scenarios

- **[Solo Developer](solo-developer.md)** -- A developer building a FastAPI app, capturing architecture decisions and knowledge across sessions
- **[Multi-Agent Team](multi-agent-team.md)** -- Three developers using Claude Code, Cursor, and Gemini on a shared project
- **[EDA Project](eda-project.md)** -- An IC design project using LibreLane with IHP SG13G2 PDK, importing artifacts and managing design decisions
- **[EDA Team](eda-team.md)** -- Four engineers supporting the IHP SG13G2 PDK collaborate across Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, and OpenCode on a shared MPW shuttle project

Each example follows the full lifecycle: initialization, daily usage, sync, and handoff.
