# Contributor License Agreement

## Context Teleport Individual CLA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Context Teleport ("the Project").
To clarify the intellectual property rights associated with contributions, we
require all contributors to sign this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
before any contribution can be accepted.

### 1. Definitions

- **"You"** means the individual submitting a Contribution.
- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including
  modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to the Project
  via pull request, patch, issue, or any other mechanism.
- **"Project"** means the Context Teleport software and all associated
  repositories.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Project maintainers a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the Project maintainers a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your
Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by
combination of your Contribution(s) with the Project.

### 4. Right to Grant

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your
employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that
you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer,
or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions.

### 5. Original Work

You represent that each Contribution is your original creation. You represent
that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party
license or other restriction of which you are aware and which are associated with
any part of your Contributions.

### 6. No Warranty

You provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or
conditions of any kind, either express or implied.

### 7. Dual Licensing Notice

You acknowledge that the Project is distributed under a dual-license model: the
GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) for open-source use, and a
separate commercial license for proprietary use. By signing this CLA, you agree
that your Contributions may be distributed under either or both of these
licenses.
